# Life-Game Simulation

![Life Game Simulation](https://github.com/arukavina/life-game/static/media/gol.jpg)

This is a Python-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, built using **Pygame**. The simulation runs an interactive version of the Life-Game, complete with a generation counter, time elapsed, and logic to detect when the generations stabilize or repeat.

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation:** Visualizes the evolution of cell generations in real-time.
- **Generation Counter:** Displays the number of generations since the start of the simulation.
- **Time Tracking:** Shows how much time has elapsed since the simulation started.
- **Stable Generations Detection:** Detects when the simulation reaches a stable state or enters a loop where new generations mirror previous ones.

## Demo
